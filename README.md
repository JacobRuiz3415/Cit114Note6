Main points
An operation System is a software that manages essential functions of a computer, such as memory, runtime, and other processes.
  OS allows the user to communicate with the computer without having to write machine code;
OS uses graphical User Interfaces, or Gui, as a way for users to interact with a computer.
There are two types of OSes, open source and proprietary.
AWS uses Linux and Windows servers, not the regular Windows.
AWS Compute Service, or EC2,  provides computing resources via the cloud.
The E means elastic, referring to the scalability of resources in this service.
AWS Lambda is a service that runs code without the use of servers.
You pay only for the computing time as a pay-as-you-go model.
Lambda does allow you to write and deploy, but you cannot manage the infrastructure.
In Lambda, you have limits of 1000 concurrent executions, 75 GB of function and layer storage, and 250 network interfaces per vpc.
Lambda is used as a testing ground for program functions as you don’t require a full server.
Container services, such as Amazon Elastic Container, allow you to manage multiple workloads.
Containers are a method of operating system virtualization where programs run in isolated resource procedures. 
The code of an application is bundled with configuration and other dependencies.
Also, containers can provide consistency for software in different environments.
Containers offer more responsiveness due to having a faster setup than virtual machines.
As a form of Platform as a service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provided a platform for quickly developing applications.
Virtual machines are software that functions like a computer and can run inside another computer.
EC2 runs virtual compute environments as known as instances.
AMIs are configuration templates for latching instances.
Instance store volumes store temporary data, which is deleted when the instance is terminated.
Amazon Elastic Store has persistent store volumes for your data.
Security in ECC uses key pairs to secure data.
There are types of instances depending on what mix of TI resources it will use.
In Ec2, create a virtual private network, VPC, to isolate it from the rest of the cloud.
 The four pillars for cost optimization are the Right size, Increase elasticity, Leverage the right pricing model, and Optimize storage.
Quotes
"The term ‘serverless’ is somewhat misleading, as there are still servers providing these backend services, but all of the server space and infrastructure concerns are handled by the vendor. Serverless means that the developers can do their work without having to worry about servers at all."
“An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.”
“Amazon EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement instances can be rapidly and predictably commissioned. The service runs within Amazon’s proven network infrastructure and data centers. The Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement commitment is 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 Region. 99.99% availability means Amazon is guaranteeing any downtime to be less than 4 minutes, 23 seconds in any month or approximately 52 minutes in a year”.
New facts
Virtual machines can be used to run outdated software that modern OSes can't run.
In a Dell computer, when you boot up, you can access The BIO, and you use commands outside of the operating system.  
Linux is based on Uniex, one of the first operations.
A Thin client is a computer that is remotely connected to a cloud server.
Raspberry pi is a computer that is a size of a business card.
A hypervisor is simply the hardware or software that runs virtual machines.
